# Swift Studio

A small web project that stays simple and useful.

## What this is
This is a small **web** project built around: **build a portfolio website with a nice 3d ui and animations and slide shows for the name Aung Thar Oo**.
It’s intentionally lightweight so it’s easy to read, run, and extend.

## How to run
- Open `index.html` in any browser.

## Project layout
- `index.html` page
- `style.css` styling
- `app.js` behavior
- `notes/` progress notes

## Next ideas
- Add one feature at a time
- Keep commits small and easy to review
- Write notes so future-you knows why things changed
